# GNURadio-Spectrum-analyzer-with-data-save

This application was part of my dissertation thesis and it uses the RTL-SDR device, a cheap, popular and versatile SDR device.

Application features:
- spectrum exploration in the frequency range of 100kHz - 6GHz, depending on the used device;
- type of receiver selection in the user interface: Spectrum analyzer with or without data recording, Mono/Stereo FM receiver with or without data recording, AM/NBFM receiver with or without data recording;
- device gain set from the interface;
- volume set, central frequency selection, frequency step selection, displayed bandwidth selection, squelch parameter set, all from the user interface;
- real time display of the spectrum, spectrogram and received signal in time domain;
- the option to save the signals in wav format, for each receiver type;
- the option to choose the sampling frequency and the number of bits per sample for saving the wav file.

The application is basically a combination of the other 3 applications I created, also available here on Github. So, either you use them separately, or you use this application which is the sum of all three apps above mentioned.  

For more information or if you need any help, you can contact me.
